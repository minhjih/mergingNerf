## Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)
The Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) model is a method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by directly optimizing a continuous volumetric scene representation. Unlike traditional 3D representation methods, NeRF uses a fully connected (non-convolutional) network, trained to map 5D coordinates to colors. The 5D coordinates contain both spatial location (3D) and viewing direction (2D). This method achieves state-of-the-art results on view synthesis benchmarks and can render high-quality novel views that are consistent with the observed data.
